## **1. Project Overview**  
This project aims to predict house prices using advanced machine learning techniques and comprehensive data analytics. It provides tools and insights for exploring real estate market trends, identifying key pricing factors, and building accurate predictive models.

### **Key Objectives:**
- Analyze house price factors (location, size, structure, and market conditions).  
- Apply machine learning models for price prediction.  
- Evaluate the performance of different algorithms.  
- Provide actionable insights for data-driven decision-making.

## **2. Dataset Description**  
The dataset contains **25+ features** and **12,500+ property records** with the following attributes:

| Feature        | Description                        | Example        |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| Lot Size       | Area of the property               | 7,200 sqft     |
| Bedrooms       | Number of bedrooms                 | 3              |
| Bathrooms      | Number of bathrooms                | 2.5            |
| Year Built     | Year of construction               | 2010           |
| Sale Price ($) | Property sale price                | 350,000        |
| Location       | City or neighborhood identifier    | "Downtown"    |

### **Statistical Summary:**
- Average house price: **$310,500**  
- Median house price: **$300,000**  
- Price range: **$150,000 to $1,200,000**  
- Average lot size: **6,850 sqft**  
- Average number of bedrooms: **3.5**

## **3. Data Analysis and Preprocessing**  
### **Key Steps:**
1. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Imputed missing values in `Lot Size`, `Year Built`, and `Bathrooms` using median strategy.
   
2. **Outlier Detection:**
   - Detected and capped price outliers beyond **3 standard deviations**.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Created `Price per SqFt` and `Age of Property` features.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - Correlation heatmaps and scatter plots.
   
### **Notable Insights:**
- Houses built after **2015** have an average price **12% higher** than older properties.  
- Properties with **3+ bathrooms** show a **20% premium** on average.
- The top 10% of properties by price have an average lot size of **10,500 sqft**.

## **4. Modeling Approach**  
### **Models Evaluated:**
1. **Linear Regression:** Simple baseline model.
2. **Random Forest Regressor:** Improved performance with feature importance analysis.
3. **Gradient Boosting Regressor:** Best-performing model with fine-tuned hyperparameters.

### **Model Performance Summary:**
| Model                 | RMSE ($) | RÂ² Score |
|------------------------|----------|-----------|
| Linear Regression      | 42,000   | 0.76      |
| Random Forest          | 31,500   | 0.88      |
| Gradient Boosting      | 29,200   | 0.92      |

## **5. Results and Insights**  
### **Key Findings:**
- **Top Price Predictors:** Lot size, location, living area, and number of bathrooms.  
- **Neighborhood Trends:** Properties in premium areas saw a **25% higher median price**.
- **Model Comparison:** Gradient Boosting performed the best, reducing prediction error by **30%** compared to Linear Regression.

### **Visualization Summary:**
- Scatter plot: Price vs. Living Area showing a **positive correlation (R=0.72)**.
- Heatmap: Feature correlations with price.
